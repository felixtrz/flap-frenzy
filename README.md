# WebXR Samples

Welcome to WebXR Samples! This production-ready template app utilizes the new [Reality Accelerator Toolkit](https://github.com/meta-quest/reality-accelerator-toolkit) to demonstrate various Mixed Reality features and is built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It is designed to help you kickstart your own WebXR mixed reality projects with ease. The template app comes with the [Becsy ECS](https://lastolivegames.github.io/becsy/) and several other useful libraries integrated, so you can focus on building your app with the best tools available.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the template app and start building your own mixed reality project.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v16.x or later recommended)
- npm (v9.x or later recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

$ git clone git@github.com:meta-quest/webxr-samples.git
$ cd webxr-samples
```

2. Install the dependencies:

$ npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

The app will be available at http://localhost:8081/ in your browser. The development server will watch for changes in your source files and automatically reload the app.

### Building for Production

> This project contains GitHub workflow [configuration](https://github.com/meta-quest/webxr-samples/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) that automatically builds and deploys the WebXR app to GitHub page.

To manually build the app for production, run the following command:

```sh
