# Flap Frenzy

Welcome to Flap Frenzy, an immersive and interactive WebXR experience built on top of the [WebXR Template App](https://github.com/meta-quest/webxr-samples). In this game, players navigate their character through a series of shrinking target rings by physically flapping their arms and adopting different poses. This dynamic and engaging experience is designed to get you moving and test your coordination and timing skills.
